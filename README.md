OwO, what's this? An intwerpreted pwogramming wanguage for watashi and watashi no fweinds? ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝ Sugoi! Watashi wonders how it works? :3

## *:･ﾟ｡ Phwhilosophwy *ੈ✩‧₊˚

1) Cwashing is >_<. That's why one uv UwU Scwipt's cwore phwhilosophwies is what I cwall the "never cwash" phwhilosophwy. If cwode can either cwash or wetuwn nwull, it should wetuwn nwull.

2) UwU Scwipt is deswigned twoo bwe as OwO as possibwle. Stwatements start wif `pwease`. Bwocks are cwosed wif `onegaishimasu`. Expwessions awe witten in pwain engwish wif `uv`, `wif`, and `and` keywords. If weading the swyntax dwoesn't make anata constanwy awoo then that's >_<

3) Cwode shwould bwe powite and elegwant. Awl indwentation shwould be done wif twabs, nwo spaces!!!1!!1

## *:･ﾟ｡ Identifiers *ੈ✩‧₊˚

Awl identifiers in the wangwage can have any numwber of letters, numbwers, letters, and spwecial chawactwers subject twoo the fowwowing westwictions:

1) Awl words in an identifier name cant be keywords.

2) An identifier may not start with a numbwer or haiphen.

3) An identifier may not contain a comma or apwostwophy.

Twoo access a mwember fwunction or vawiable, u can use the `'s` symbol. For exampwe, the twaditionawl `foo.bar` becomes `foo's bar` in UwUScwipt.

## *:･ﾟ｡ Data taipus *ੈ✩‧₊˚

### Bwooleans 

Thwere awe two bwoolean vawues. Twue, and fwalse. These can bwe written wif keywords `twue` and `fwalse`.

### Numbwers 

Awl Numbwers awe wepwesented intwernawy as dwouble pwescision fwoats. They can bwe witten as `25`, `72.4`, `-15`, `-15.45`, etc. Awl nwumbers awe twufy.

### Stwings 

A stwing is wewesented by a `*`, any twext, then `*`. The chawactwer `:` is an escwape chawactwer. Swome contwol chawactwers cwan bwe witten uswing spwecial swyntax. `:3` is a nwew wine, `:>` is a twab, and `:\` is eqwivawent twoo `\r` in normie stwings. `*` chawactwers cwan bwe witten wif `:)`, but any othwer chawactwers aftwer a `:` will wesult in a swyntax ewwor. These escape sequences can optionawwy have a space aftew them.

`pwease set hewwo twoo *Hewwo UwU*`

`pwease set doubwe line twoo *OwO? :3 Multiwine stwing?*`

### Nwull 

The spwecial keyword `nwull` wepwesents a nwull vawue.

A nwull vawue is a spwecial vawue. Any opewations on a nwull vawue awe stiwl nwull.

## *:･ﾟ｡ Impweratwive stwatements *ੈ✩‧₊˚ 

### Comments 

The spwecial keyword `whispers` begins a swingle line comment. The keyword `nuzzles` begins a mwultiline comment which terminates wif `teehee`

`pwease set x twoo 0	 whispers this sets x to zero for all you normies :3`

```
nuzzles
pwease set x twoo sum uv 3 and 5 UwU
teehee
```

### Asswignmwent 

`pwease set mai numbwer twoo 25`

`pwease set gweeting twoo *Hewwo! UwU*`

### Opewations and expwessions

Awl opewations awe fwunction for ease uv impwementation. That means they follow fwunction swyntax.

`FNAME OwO`

`FNAME wif/uv ARG1 UwU`

`FNAME wif/uv ARG1 and ARG2`

`FNAME wif/uv ARG1, ARG2, [ARGI,] and ARGN`

These awe the opewators:

`sum` - Calcuwates the sum uv awl argumwents.

`pwoduct` - Calcuwates the pwoduct uv awl argumwents.

`diffwence` - Calcuwates the diffewence uv two argumwents a and b.

`diwision` - Gives the wesult uv `a / b`.

`wemainder` - Gives the wemainder uv `a / b`. (Simiwar twoo mod).

`negative` - Gives the negative uv a nwumber.

`absowute` - Gives the absowute vawue uv a nwumber.

`fwoor` - Gives fwoor uv a nwumber

`wound` - Gives wound uv a nwumber

`ceiwing` - Gives ceiwing uv a nwumber

`sqware woot` - Gives sqware woot uv a nwumber

`is bwiger` - Gives twue if a is bwiger than b, fawse othewwise. Gives nwull if no compawison can bwe pwefowmed.

`is smowwer` - Same as `is bwiger` but smol.

`as bwig as` - Gives twue if a is as bwig as b, fawse othewwise. Gives nwull if no compawison can bwe pwefowmed.

`as smol as` - Same as `as bwig as` but smol.

`same` - Gives twue if a and b awe the same.

`not same` - Gives twue if a and b awe not the same.

`both` - Gives twue if a and b awe twufy.

`neither` - Gives twue if neither a nor b awe twufy.

`either` - Gives twue if either a or b awe twufy.

`conneko` - Known by normies as `concat`.

`nwumber` - Casts data twoo a nwumber.

`stwing` - Casts data twoo a stwing.

Thewe awe awso some spwecial fwunctions:

`pwint` - Pwint awl awgumwents twoo the console.

`nani` - Like pwint, but asks the usew fwor a stwing and gwives the wesult.

`moshi moshi` - Like nani, but awso casts the wesult to a nwumber.

And for awways/maps, you can use.

`index` - Takes a cwassu instance and a stwing/nwumber and gives cwassu instance at that vawue. (Kind uv like squawe bwackets in normie languages).

`update index` - Takes a cwassu instance, an index, and a vawue, and sets the cwassu at that index twoo that vawue.

### Conditional bwanching and loops 

```
pwease set x twoo 0

	pwease set x twoo sum uv x and 1 UwU

	iffu mod uv x and 3
		iffu is equal uv mod uv x and 5 UwU and 0

pwease give do stuff
```

```
pwease set utils woad *utils*

pwease cawl utils UwU
```

## *:･ﾟ｡ Code styling *ੈ✩‧₊˚ 

### Naming convwentions

Cwode names shwould be carfuwwy cewected twoo enswure that the cwode that u wite flows natuwally. They shwould awso bwe as UwU as pwossibwe, awthough that goes without saying :3 Awoid bowing names like `gcd` or `fast square root`. Instead use `bwiggest simiwar numbwer twait` and `wow u found square woot so fast! :3`

### wif vs uv 

Whiwe `wif` and `uv` awe tweated as the same in cwode, they cawwy very diffwent meanings in pwactice. `wif` shwould bwe used wif fwunctions that have swide effwects. Fwo exampwe, `pwease call` shwould aways use `wif` 

### OwO and UwU 

`OwO` and `UwU` both cwose off fwunctions. They shwould be used awternating between `OwO` and `UwU` depwending on how deep they awe in the expwession.

### Commenting cwode

Cwode shwould be easiwy undewstandable, but sometimes a smawl comment can go a long way! When witing comments, twy to mwake the comment as weadabwe as possibwe. In keeping wif phwhilosophwy 3, make your comments fwo natuwawly. For exampwe, `whispers this is a comment` shwould bwe `whispers that this is a comment`. Or, as a mwore extweme exampwe...

```
nuzzles
	simple ternary function
teehee

pwease set tewnawy twoo fwunction cond awg1 and awg2
	...
```

Shwould instead bwe changed twoo somethwing like...

```
nuzzles yo necky wecky
you see this fwunction? *rubs yo bulgey-wuldgey* this wittwe fwunction lets u give awg1 iffu cond is twue annnnnd... *licks my lips sensuawwy* awg2 if cond is fawse.
oh, wook at how big ur getting, hehe. U like it? :3 I cwoded it myself, teehee

pwease set tewnawy twoo fwunction cond awg1 and awg2
	...
```
